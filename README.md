## Battleships
This is where I keep my updated Battleships projects. Battleships is a game which Wikipedia can explain better than I ever could so [click here if you want to look at the article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))

### There are currently 2 projects in this solution:
  - Battleships v1
    - This is my first semi-big project in C#. This version is against a bot that just guesses randomly so it's easier to win
  - Battleships v2 (WIP)
    - **This is the project I am currently working on.** This version is against a bot that will guess randomly too, however will seek out more ships if it gets a hit

## Chapters
Chapters is the actual learning that I do from school for C#. This is the "Basics" with programs that ask for things, and in Chapter 5 is actually where the Battleships program is from. 

### There are 7 Chapters uploaded.
  - Chapter 1
    - **Welcome to C#** - Goes through setting up VS, and the very basics of C#
    - This is all in one project because I didn't know how solutions worked
  - Chapter 2
    - **Using Variables** - What's a variable? How many are there? What can you do with them? All here
  - Chapter 3
    - **Using Selection** - if/else and switch/case statements
  - Chapter 4
    - **Looping** - for, while and do/while loops
  - Chapter 5
    - **Arrays** - Arrays, Lists and Structs
  - Chapter 6
    - **Subroutines and Functions** - How to declare/call them and ByVal vs. ByRef
  - Chapter 7
    - **String Handling** - What can you do with strings?

## Kata
Kata are challenges in [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). They earn Kyu, which is why each solution is named ```x Kyu```.
The ranking goes from 8 to 1, 8 being the easiest and 1 being the hardest

## Misc Programming Tasks & dotnet6
- **Misc Programming Tasks** is all of the little tasks that my teacher tells us to do in class which isn't actually part of the chapter but does require me to have another project dedicated to it.
- **dotnet6** is the version of that which uses the .NET 6 framework instead of the .NET 5 framework. This is necessary because my teachers are mad that the .NET 6 doesn't include namespaces and classes natively.
